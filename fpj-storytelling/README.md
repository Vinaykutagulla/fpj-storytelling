# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Accessibility notes

This project includes several accessibility improvements beyond the default CRA template:

- Landmarks and navigation
	- Primary navigation has a descriptive aria-label and uses aria-current on the active page.
	- A “Skip to content” link jumps to the main landmark for keyboard and screen reader users.
- Sections and progress
	- Content sections are focus and screen reader discoverable via role="region" with aria-labelledby headings.
	- A floating progress indicator exposes an ARIA progressbar with aria-valuemin/max/now and a tooltip via aria-describedby.
	- A polite live region announces section changes while scrolling.
- Interactive components
	- Tabs (Services and About) implement the WAI-ARIA pattern: role=tablist/tab/tabpanel, aria-selected, aria-controls/labelledby, and keyboard navigation (ArrowLeft/Right, Home/End).
	- The 3D molecule card is keyboard activatable (role=button, Enter/Space) with aria-pressed, and includes reduced-motion friendly behavior.
- Semantics
	- Lists are proper ul/li structures and key metrics use dl/dt/dd for improved semantics.

If you add new sections or components, mirror these patterns to maintain an accessible experience.
