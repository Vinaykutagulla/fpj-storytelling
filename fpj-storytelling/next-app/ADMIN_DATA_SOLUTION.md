# Admin Dashboard Data Issue - Solutions

## Current Problem
The admin dashboard shows 0 applications because:
- Applications are stored in **memory** (not database)
- Memory gets **reset on every server restart/deployment**
- Vercel restarts servers frequently, wiping all data

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Set Up Supabase Database (Recommended)
This provides permanent, scalable storage for all applications.

#### Steps:
1. **Create Supabase Account**: Go to https://supabase.com
2. **Create New Project**: Choose a database password
3. **Get API Keys**: 
   - Go to Settings → API
   - Copy the "URL" and "service_role" key (not anon key)
4. **Add Environment Variables to Vercel**:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```
5. **Run Database Migration** (already prepared):
   - Use the SQL in `supabase-setup.sql`
   - Creates the `partner_applications` table

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Permanent storage
- ✅ Scalable for thousands of applications
- ✅ Backup and recovery
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Analytics and reporting

### Option 2: File-Based Storage (Quick Fix)
I've created a file storage system that persists data between restarts.

#### Implementation:
- Created `src/lib/fileStorage.ts`
- Stores applications in `data/applications.json`
- Survives server restarts (but not full redeployments)

#### To Use File Storage:
1. Update application submission API to use file storage
2. Update admin API to read from file storage
3. Redeploy

### Option 3: External Database Service
- Use Railway, PlanetScale, or other database service
- Similar to Supabase but different providers

## Recommendation
**Use Supabase** - it's free for your current usage level and provides the most robust solution.

## Current State
- ✅ All application logic is working correctly
- ✅ Auto-approval and referral code generation working
- ✅ Email system ready (needs Resend API key)
- ❌ Data not persisting due to memory storage
